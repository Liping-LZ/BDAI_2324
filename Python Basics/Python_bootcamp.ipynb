        "Since we might be using Python in the module to deal with big data processing and big data analytics, I think it is good opportunity for you to have some initial understanding of python coding. However, in the class, you will be given template coding scripts and you will be given full guidance to run the codes even if you do not have the time to complete this bootcamp. It might be easier for you to understand things quicker if you know some Python basics. If you have already learned Python in your previous study or work, then it is not necessary to do this bootcamp since this bootcamp only covers the basics of Python. We will cover further topic (i.e. forecasting, prediction) in class and you will know how to realise different analytics techniques with Python. Please note that Python might not be the only tool to use in the class. We might be introducing the use of Matlab and Excel in class. Also, we will be using Tableau for data visualisation.\n",

If you are running your codes through Terminal in your local machine, .py file is usually recommended. Also, if you are building web apps in Python, .py file is also recommended. In most of cases, you can use notebook file directly for coding and saving file.\n",

        "      We are recommending installl Python through Anaconda distribution. This will simplify the package management and deployment. The distribution includes data-science packages suitable for Windows, Linux, and macOS. This will make it much easier to install and use python and other add-ons.\n",
        "      \n",
        "      Firstly, visit https://www.anaconda.com/download from your browser of choice. The correct version for your operating system (Windows or Mac or Linux) can be selected (if this does not happen automatically) by clicking on the appropriate logo at the top of the page. Irrespective of your operation system, you are suggested to choose graphical installer. For Windows, select the appropriate bit-type for your machine (usually 64-bits), and for Mac select the appropriate one depending on whether you are using Macbook with Intel processor or with Apple silicon (introduced in 2021 or later).\n",
        "      \n",
        "      Once it is downloaded, run the downloaded executable file to start installing. Follow the on-screen instructions and accept the default settings.Once the installation is complete, launch Anaconda Navigator from the Start menu.Here we recommend you use Jupyter Notebook to start coding. Once the Anaconda Navigator is launched, you should be able to see \"Jupyter Notebook\" on the menu. Simply click \"Launch\", you will see a kernel window (terminal window) starts first and then a browser window where you will be able to create folder and file to edit and run codes.\n",
        "\n",
        "      With Anaconda, you can also access other text editor or IDE to edit and run your codes. For example, you can also use VSCode, or PyCharm or Spyder, up to your choice.\n",

        "      \n",

        "\n",
        "      A text editor is a software application that allows you to write and edit plain text files. Unlike word processors, text editors don't add formatting to text, making them ideal for coding. They often come with features like syntax highlighting, line numbering, and auto-completion, which can significantly enhance your coding experience and efficiency.\n",
        "\n",
        "      Microsoft VSCode (https://code.visualstudio.com/) is one of the recommendations that you can go for. It's free and lightweight. But it has many extensions. You can add tools for almost any coding task. Plus, it works with Python notebooks, making it a viable option for students on either specialism.\n",

        "Thirdly, as detailed in the operators shown in section 6, we increase the value of prize using the command prize += 100 (meaning the prize is increased by 100 if the player wins).\n",
        "The final “new” code in this example relates to the random library. At various points we make calls to the random.randint( ) function. randint is a shortened version of “random integer” and, as this suggests, the function will draw a random number between the first value passed and the last value passed. So random.randint(2, 14) will draw a random integer between 2 and 14.\n",
